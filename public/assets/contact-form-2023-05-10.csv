As we approach the upcoming Gastech 2023 from 05 – 08 Sep 2023 at Singapore Expo, we would like to explore opportunities of rendering our services to support your participation. 

It would be wonderful if we could have the opportunity to work in tandem to achieve your trade show objectives, beginning with the development of a design proposal for your exhibition booth, with no obligations. 
 
However, if you already have a design in mind, we could also assist in realising the fabrication of your stand. Attached you will find some of our works executed at the previous exhibitions. 

Let us know what would work best for you and hear from you soon.","","289","2023-04-11 15:22:05","https://marathonheat.com/contact-us/","","","","","","Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/112.0.0.0 Safari/537.36","180.129.77.166"

"Rick Carlson","2542779040","RC0322@ProNovaPartners.com","Others","ProNova Partners would like to collaborate with you on the sale of your business ASAP.  Buyer demand is sky-high for our offerings - we closed many of the new engagements we were hired for nationwide in 2022 despite the pandemic and the intial onset of a recession.  Valuations are ridiculous {STILL}, our closing timeframes are short, and the good times I'm afraid won't last forever.  Interest rates will rise eventually, which will make it increasingly harder for Buyers to leverage up & pay 4-9x (PLUS) NET income on the best opportunities, plus there lies the possiblity of long term capital gains taxes on the sale of your business nearly doubling in the future possibly....The time is now!

If you're interested in selling or just checking in on the valuation of your enterprise, please feel free to reach out to me directly to book an appointment {CONFIDENTIALLY} to explore further:  https://www.calendly.com/pronova

On our end - we had 25 closings in 2022, with a dozen more (ranging from $230k to $72MM all-cash) closings scheduled in the next few months and we're running low on salable inventory again.  M&A marches onward despite these uncertain times!!  

I'd ideally like to take some time to begin a discussion on the sale of your Company & we can commence 'packaging' this opportunity together so we can hopefully go to market and close by year-end.  If you disagree, for whatever reason, hopefully just give me a follow up date that you think makes sense and I can circle back with you at that time.  

But why ProNova Partners?

- We have plenty of cash buyers that are active & decisive acquirers for good inventory.  
- We possess the network and the experiences to orchestrate virtually any transaction from initial consultation to the close of escrow in a timely manner.
- We pay for upgraded advertising which in turn ensures maximum exposure to your business far beyond our company database of 32,214+ buyers looking for interesting targets.
- We specialize in highly-sensitive and confidential sales and recognize its importance, therefore all buyers have an NDA on file with us.
- We work together with our highly skilled team to produce top-tier marketing materials and pitch books that impel buyers to write offers.
- We are experts in valuation - by applying the correct valuation strategy to your firm, we can therefore negotiate the highest possible price for your business.
- We understand the importance of time to close, and considering all of the above we also have an average 90 days to close for our buyers / sellers.
- We are a success fee firm, unless we close the transaction for you, there is no charge to you.

The first step to a happy exit is discovering what’s important to you. Take a PREScore questionnaire. Let’s take that first step together by visiting my homepage:  https://www.pronovapartners.com/

Tank contains sensors for water level indication. 1st sensor install at 0.15 m height for low level indication. we have to install heater below that height. The Total capacity of heater is 90 kW. We can install three heaters of 30kW instead of a single heater. There is a need to provide flange to fix heater in cantilever position. kindly design heater in such a way that total capacity can't be changed and install in given dimension of tank. 

Your suggestions will be highly appreciated.

"Daniel Jason","5168562184","it.mvwsusa5@gmail.com","Sales","Hello Sir/Madam,
My self Daniel, from an Internet Marketing Company. I would like to tell you some points about your online business. I hope you won’t mind spending only 2-3 minutes to have a look at the following lines:
It seems you've been spending your budget with sponsored listings or PPC.
. In PPC, you may get the sales but only after paying a certain amount every time and if you stop paying, then the sales will vanish soon.
 . In SEO, You need to budget for a few months. Once keywords will be on the first page of Google, you can get satisfied traffic for a long time. 
. 90% of users like Organic results over the sponsored ones because these results are more relevant and valuable. So just imagine how many valuable customers you are losing by not focusing on organic search results.

By investing a few months in SEO, you can see drastic changes in your  website internally and externally. We'll show you TOP Rankings in your  keywords, link popularity, organic traffic and many more...

After reviewing your website , I noticed some major on-page and off-page issues need to be fixed soon. For more information about your site errors, please respond to my email.
I would be happy to provide you with a Complete Site Analysis Report (free of cost) with our Company Profile, Work Experience and Client Testimonials. 
Our main AIM is customer satisfaction. We are not like others. We've limited customers and make sure they are really happy with our performance. 
You may be interested with Big Big Companies but I can say they're taking money only showing their company brand to customers; otherwise the result part is Zero. Decision is yours!
We wish you the best of luck and look forward to a long and healthy business relationship with you and your company.
Waiting for your positive response… 
Best Regards,
Daniel Jason

I am Marc, I was browsing the Web and came across marathonheat.com which I really liked.

I noticed that marathonheat.com has lesser reviews on G than some of your competitors.

I have developed a technique to generate multiple 5 star reviews almost on AutoPilot! 

Do you want me to teach it to you and help you generate a lot of 5 star reviews each month? 

No catch, you will be up and running in less than 15 minutes.

My name is Emma, Content Writer and Outreach Manager at Post Market Publishing / Outreach Master.
I expect you receive a load of emails, every day from companies promising the world and telling you why
they are the best.

When it comes to our Media Placement and Link Building/Guest Post offering, our strategy is slightly
different. Focussing on three key pillars: Building Trust, Authority, and Relevance with our clients via
our outreach campaigns, we are proud that the results we are able to deliver speak for themselves.

If you have ever used an agency for your Guest Post Link Building, I would love you to give us a try and
compare our offering and service against your current strategy. You can then measure our results and
the performance of our campaigns for yourself.

Please let me know if you are interested, or have any additional questions.
